Your task is to provide a detailed and accurate breakdown of the business process in a structured format. Ensure that the process flow is clearly delineated, and all decision points are systematically resolved as per BPMN standards.

                Details to include:

                Events:
                - Start Event: Describe the initial event that triggers the process.
                - End Event: Describe the final event that concludes the process.

                Tasks/Activities:
                - List all tasks and activities involved in the process along with a brief description of each.

                Gateways (Splitting/Joining Points):
                - Exclusive Gateways: Describe any points within the process where the flow can ONLY go in ONE direction, including the conditions that determine the direction the flow needs to take.
                - Parallel Gateways: Describe any points within the process where the flow MUST go in MULTIPLE directions.
                Note: Ensure each gateway opened in the process is correspondingly closed, exclusive splits must eventually meet in exclusive joins (with ending process within a direction of exclusive gateway being the only exception), and parallel splits must meet with parralel joins.

                Flows:
                - Sequence Flows: Detail all sequence flows, explaining how tasks and events are interconnected. Ensure accurate representation of the flow, maintaining the order of activities as described. Confirm that each element is connected with only two sequence flows, except for end events and start events, these have only one sequence flow. Flows arent allowed to bi-directional, so there has to be a check exclusive gateway if a recurring activity is needed to be done"""
